# PgnJS Tests

For now testing only consist in loading the wiki text in this folder in a running mediawiki and
observing the result.

## PgnViewerJS Tests

There is a single file `example.html` that can be used to test that PgnViewerJS works correctly on
the server (file permission, etc). If necessary, edit the path to PgnViewerJS assets in the file.
